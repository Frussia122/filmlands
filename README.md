# Filmsland - Online Cinema

![Filmsland Logo](link_to_logo_image)

Welcome to Filmsland - your cozy online cinema! Here you can enjoy the most captivating movies and TV shows in a user-friendly interface. Regardless of your preferences, we have a wide selection of content to satisfy even the most demanding viewers.

## About the Project

Filmsland is a web application developed using modern technologies to provide you with the best movie-watching experience. Built on the React framework, the app utilizes Redux Toolkit (RTK) and axios for state management and data fetching. React Router DOM is used for navigation.

For the backend of the project, we employed powerful tools: ASP.NET for creating our custom movie API with a MySQL database, as well as Node.js for implementing the user authentication and registration system. While currently using MongoDB for user data, it will eventually transition to MySQL as well.

Formik and Yup were utilized for form validation, ensuring a smooth user experience. TypeScript has been adopted for comprehensive type definitions.

## Current Status

At present, the Filmsland project is in its early development stage. We have successfully implemented the basic functionality and are pleased to announce that the project is about 20% complete. Here's what we have accomplished so far:

- **Homepage:** Here you will find a selection of current movies and TV shows to begin your cinematic journey.

- **Authentication and Registration:** We have designed a user-friendly system for authentication and registration, allowing you to save your preferences and share your impressions.

- **Partially Completed User Profile:** The user profile section is under development, and we have already added some features such as profile editing.

- **Partially Completed Movie Page:** Learn more about the movie that interests you on a page with detailed descriptions and information.

- **In-progress: Catalog with Filters:** We are actively working on the catalog section, which will enable you to filter movies using various criteria for easy discovery of content.

## Future Plans

We aspire to make Filmsland the premier destination for online movie-watching, and we have ambitious plans for the future:

- **Expanding the User Profile:** We will develop full user profile functionality, including notifications, subscriptions, a list of favorite movies, and more.

- **Enhancing the Catalog:** The catalog will be enriched with numerous filters to help you precisely find movies that align with your interests.

- **Improved Design and Interface:** We always aim for excellence, so we plan to enhance the design and interface for a more satisfying user experience.
